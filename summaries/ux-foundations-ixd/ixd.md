# Interaction Design

Can be approached as:

* **Dimensions** of focus
* **Models** of methods and processes
* Guiding **principles**

## Five Dimensions of IxD

By Gillian Crampton Smith and Kevin Silver.

* **Words** (content): should be easy to understand and written to effectively communicate information.
* **Visual representations**: diagrams, illustrations, graphics, and even typographic styles and media to clarify data and concepts.
* **Physical objects or space**: physical hardware, such as keyboard, mouse, or smartphone, and the space necessary to use it effectively.
* **Time**: the time during which people interact with the product and how they might measure their progress.
* **Behavior**: actions, reactions, and emotions people have when interacting with a product.

## Design Thinking

Exploratory and iterative methods are effective when we are facing problems that are vague or not understood.

We need to:

* Understand people and problems.
* Change assumptions.
* Generate solutions.

Different methods helps us to:

* **Diverge**: is the process of generating multiple ideas.
* **Converge**: is the process of choosing the best of those ideas.

### Design Thinking mehtods

1. Observe and empathize.
1. Explore and create.
1. Build and deliver.
1. Iterate and improve.

### Core Design Principles

1. Understand people and their context.
1. Define a product's purpose based on people's needs and goals.
1. Craft experiences for efficient flow.
1. Deliver meaningful, relevant, and valuable experiences.
1. Ensure products easy to use, learn, and remember.
1. Always respect and protect the people who use our products and sercives.

## Levels of design

### Structure

It focus on the overall oreganization and architecture of the product. We identify and define the systematic structire of content and functionality.

#### Scent of Information

It's derived from informatioon foraging theory, this is how people can *predict* what they will find if they follow a path or flow through a product.

#### Three levels of Structure

* **Product**: overall architecture defines all of their sections, the purpouse of each, and the navigation and connections among them.
* **Screen**: what belongs on each page or screen and where should it appear? What appears on all multiple screens? Placement can communicate importance, relationships, and functionality.
* **Component**: define the content and interactivity of individual elements on the screen. We are not yet focused on final appearance, because we first need to validate that the structure and flow are correct.

### Flow

Here we identify and define all of the sreps people must take and the states of the product as they work toward their goal.

#### Three levels of Flow

* **Multi-channel ecosystem**: many products and services are used in conjunction with others. How does the product fit into a larger ecosystem? What are the paths though the product and the states of the product.
* **Product**: indentify the paths through the product and all of the steps and actions necessary to complete tasks. There is at least one path for each function. There may be more than one path to achieve the same goal.
* **Components**: identify abd describe the various states if interactivity screens and components. Define the conditions that produce each and the outcomes that may result.

#### Simple flows

Simple tasks tend to be brief, direct, and linear.

#### Complex flows

Complex tasks tend to have multiple decision points, branching, and repeat actions, and have multiple states contingent upon context and prior interactions or choices.

#### Nested flows

* Flows may also be nested within other flows.
* There may be sub-steps, multiple paths, interactions across products and channels, and multi-session interactions.
* Design to effectively communicate place, state, and progress.

### Interface

At this level, we focus on appearance and behavior, but this is also the stage where we add the polish, nuance, and refinement that can differentiate a product.

#### More than Brand and Identity

Appearance and behavior can:

* Clarify structure and flow.
* Clarify and enhance content
* Guide through a path
* Enhance feedback
* Help people identify opportunities to transfer and apply their prior experiences.

#### Appearance, Meaning, and value

* Good design enhances the value and quality of a product.
* Bad design detracts from or even interferes with a product experience.
* Prople judge the quality of a product higher and think it works better when it is attractive.
