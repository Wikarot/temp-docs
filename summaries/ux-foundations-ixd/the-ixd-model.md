# The Interaction Design Model

The behavior on the [interaction design model](a-model-of-psychology-and-ixd.md/#introducing-the-interaction-design-model) is the actual interaction with the product, and it has its own cycle.

```txt
... -->
--> PERCEIVE -->
--> PREDICT -->
--> INTERACT -->
--> FEEDBACK -->
--> LEARN -->
--> PRACTICE / REMEMBER -->
--> ...
```

## Percieve

People are less likely to interact if they do not perceive the opportunity to interact, even if they need or want to interact.

> People must understand there are things they can do.

Good design solutions **increase the perceivability** of opportunities to interact as well as **inform people** about the appropriate or correct ways to interact.

> We bring our past experiences and learning to every new experience.

### Perceivability

* More than just a visual signal and cues.
* **All content and interactions must be accessible for all people**.
* Gestures and voice interaction often lack perceivable signals and cues, so people often do not know what they can do or say

### Multiple possible interactions

* MAny products offer many functions and services, but ussually need only one a few per use.
* We quickly process our options and select the most salient and relevant, and then ignore the rest.

## Predict

### Confidence

If people are confident that their interaction with a product will help them achieve their goals, then the probability of intraction increases.

### Deciding among options

When there are different ways to complete a task, people decide based on:

* Context
* Goal
* Prior experience
* Perveivability
* Confidence
