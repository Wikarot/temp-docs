# Introductory Psychology

## Sensation

Most important senses interaction focuses on are: vision, hearing, touch, and proprioception.

What the user sees and how, keeping in mind possible user visual deficiencies, what the user hears when something happens, nothing or some sound signals, how the user squeezes or drags an element, the device vibrates or not, how the elements on the UI are distributed and percieved.

## Perception

Is the fact of processing and recognizing the information we get through the senses.

Environmental conditions can change the way we perceive things, but we still manage to do that with great consistency due to the brain "magic".

Shape, lightness, color, distance, size, location, and timbre are some of these conditions.

## Gestalt principles

Starting in 1910, Max Wertheimer, a German psychologist, noticed that a series of blinking likghts creates the illusion of motion. The *Phi Effect*.

* Gestalt means "shape and form".
* We perceive the world as meaningful and complete objects, not a series of independent parts.

### Gestalt Laws

* Figure-ground: how we organize our perceptions in terms of foreground objects, the clearly defined ones, and background objects, which may be unbounded or vaguely defined.
* Simplicity: how we organize our perceptions into the simplest possible experience.
* Proximity: objects near one tnother in space or time, are perceived as being a group.
* Similarity: objects with similar characteristics, such as form, color, size, and brightness, are preceived as belonging together.
* Common fate: how objects moving together are perceived as belonging together.
* And others like closure, continuity, and symmetry.

## Affordances

* Physical characteristics of objects make possible what we are able to do.
* We recognize when we are able to interact.
* Affordabces are relavite to the individual and their ability to interact.

* It don't require conscious attention and thought.
* It arise from our intrinsic understanding of our physical relationship with the world arround us.

Don Norman introduced the concept of the *perceived affordance*. When people perceive similarity between a digital representation and an actual physical object.

We might use common depth cues, like:

* Shadows
* Perspective
* Overlap / Layers
* Blur
* Scale
