## Why psychology?

Understading how people feel, think, understand the information, and make decisions, can help us generate better ideas and solutions and help us craft and deliver better experiences.

The core model is:

* Discover (study and insigts) [this course]
* Craft (design and prototype) [this course]
* Deliver (develop and measure)
* Improve (iterate and optimize)

### Discover

**Identify** (research about) the problem to be solved or need to be met.

By researching we need to:

* Measure (objective, quantitative data)
* Observe (subjective data that may be qualitative or quantitative)
* Ask (self-report data that may be qualitative or quantitative)

**Define**, describe the problem or need and the desired outcome or goal.

**Frame**, place the solution and outcome in the larger context of the person and the product or service.

### Craft

**Design** from an abducting reasoning, critical thinking, and problem-solving.

**Prototype**, evaluate if our design decisions are working, and identify alternatives if not.

**Iterate**, designing and prototyping are iterative processes, we generate, evaluate, and adjust ideas repeatedly to identify the best solution.
