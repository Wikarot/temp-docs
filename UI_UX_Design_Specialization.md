# UI / UX Design Specialization

## Visual Elements of User Interface Design

### What is a User Interface

It's the _bridge_ between user and content.

### The Relationship between UI and UX

UI:

- How it looks / **Visual design**.
- Form, aesthetics, look & feel, organization.
- Design driven.

UX:

- How it feels / **Non-visual design**.
- Feel, navigation, story, structure.
- User driven.

### A Brief Historical Overview of Interface Design

We need to have _feedback_, know when the interface is working or not, know if we make a mistake or it is all right, be able to undo and redo our actions.

### Interface Conventions: Theory

An interface should be based on:

- Real world knowladge (analog models).
- Learned behaviour (conventions).
- Cause and effect (action / reaction).
- Consistency (logic / systematic).
- Seamless (speed and ease).
- Immediate intuition (a few teach a lot).
- Fulfillment (payoff / results).
- Undo / redo / confirm (feel safe).

### Template vs Content

The right interface is based on _content_, _context_ and _functionality_ for a specific _audience_.

Generic templates can work for some UI elements or components. Not for an entire interface. That leads us to a _generic experience_ (a poor experience).

### Aesthetics & Functionality

Aesthetics and functionality are different things, but, UI should always be related and familiar to the functionality.

Realationship is making it easy to know **how it works** by **how it looks**.

### Design Before Design

Project Brief (how it all starts):

- What is it?
- Who is it for?
- Where does it live?

It is the **non-visual pre-design**.

Client determines and must be clear about:

- Goals.
- Constraints.
- Platform.
- Audience.

### Look and Feel

Defining **style** and **mood** helps to envision the overall design (pre-design).

Look and feel defines:

- Mood.
- Typography.
- Color palette.
- Language.

### Language as a design tool

Language sets mood and tone.

We need to define **naming** and **branding** for the UI by specifying the audience, their _actitude_ and _motivation_ to use the app / web.

### Color & Shape

Use color and shape to define _association_, _functionality_ and _state_ of UI elements. That lets the user know if an element is unabled, active or inactive.

### Imagery

**Imagery as content**: Can be videos, search engines and all images _in boxes_.

A special case is the **immersive imagery**. It is used for games, apps and animations. By its own, they create the context, a whole world / universe for the product, where things don't have to _live in boxes_ anymore.

**Imagery as navigation**: They are icons, symbols and links to some other content or functionality.

**Imagery as mood**: They contribute to the look and feel, can be a part of the contetn or the navigation.

### Typography

Type is language made physical, is fast, is accurate and clear meaning, is economical, and can represent what cannot be depicted.

**Type as content**: Typographic material, articles, blogs, books, etc.

**Type as interface**: Labels, butttons and navigation.

**Type as branding**: The app or site identity.

### Icons

**Icon**: Pictorial representation (realistic / descriptive). We use to _know_ what an icon _is_.

**Symbol**: Non-pictorial representation (abstract). We use to _learn_ what a symbol _means_.

Sometimes a single image can act as both an icon and a symbol.

What makes a good icon?

- Communication (ideas + aesthetics).
- Functionality (technical).
- Audience (use gets it!).
- Recognition (saturation + simplicity).

### Functionality

Creating a logical UI is creating a **predictable system**.

A UI must combine **logic**, **hierarchy** and **systematic** behaviours. While using the **intuition**, **discovery** and **learning**.

These facts help the user to interact fast and easily, as we make an economic interface. Economizing UI elements and user actions, saving time and doing more with less.

### Speed and Style

Speed:

✔ Simple / direct  
✔ Unambiguous  
✔ Rapidly adoptable  
✔ Familiar / predictable  
✔ Logical  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring

Style:

✔ Entretaining  
✔ Engaging  
✔ Rewarding experience  
✔ Brandable  
✔ Novel / individual  
❌ Obstructs Content  
❌ Time-consuming  
❌ Frustrating experience  
❌ Dates rapidly  
❌ Unnecessaty

### Composition and Structure

Content-specific design: Sometimes, the structure is all the content, and its functionality drives all the design decisions.

### Buttons

Size: Must be related to the size of the _cursor_, _finger_ and the _screen_.  
Shape: Meaningful for _functionality_, depending on its _label_ and the _screen_.  
Color: It can make it easy to recognise _what a button is made for_ (even without a label).  
Dimension: Making a button _similar_ to a real one, makes the UI intuitive.  
System: Buttons need to have a _logic placement_ on screen to make sense by theirself.

### Not Buttons

<!-- asdasdasd -->
Menus, links, fields. Use design convestions for these elements, for _shape_, _scale_, _contrast_, _clarity_ and _economy_, in order to reinforce and emphasize the goals of speed and function.

### States and Changes

Let the user know the UI element is responsive (is working) by adding visual states, _normal_, _hover_, _active_, _inactive_.

Think about the differet static elements states as well as how your elements animate between states.

### Hierarchy of Content

Figure out _what goes where_, and _why_:

- **Function**, what's (and what's NOT) important to the user?
- **Intention**, what's (and what's NOT) important to the client?

It's critical to define **the scene**, **the thinking**, and **phisical reacting**:

- What's the first thing the user _sees_?
- What's the user's _first impression_?
- What's the first thing the user _does_?

### Conventions and Expectations

_Small screen: single task + multiple screens_.

By convension we focus on a single task when working on a small screen, even when multiple functions are available, we keep them hidden, until we need them.

_Big screen: multiple tasks + single screen_.

In this case, we can focus on multiple tasks on a single big screen as we have enogh space to work.

## UX Design Fundamentals

### Ideation

Take ideas. Ideas come from _client_. Ideas should be about **content**, **concept** and **needs**.

- Good ideas
  - Real problems
  - Solvable by app
  - Loved by users
- Good process
  - Research
  - Testing
  - Revisions
- Good focus
  - Articulation
  - Clarity
  - User feedback

#### Goals

We need to know:

- **What does it do?** For Ideation & Articulation.
- **How does it work?** For Research & Development.
- **Who benefits from it?** For Audience & Rationale.
- **Why would someone use it?** For Goals & Outcomes.

### Research & Development

Check out the _competition_:

- Waht apps exists that do the same thing?
- What apps do something similar?
- Waht apps are content adjaceent?
- What apps are structural models?

Develop and test new ideas. Map possibilities. Shape your solution.

### Audience & Rationale

Identify your _audience_:

- Who benefits from my app?
- Who is my audience?
- Who is my _initial_ user target group?

Differentiate audience through political, economic, social, functional and other categories.

That is **User Centered Design**.

### Goals & Outcomes

We need to define 100% beetwen:

- **Political**: Fulfill out _main objective_.
- **Financial**: Make money.
- **Social**: Build community.
- **Functional**: Provide a useful app.

### Naming and Mission

Naming has to have a topic to be based on (mythological, contemporary, scientific, historical, fictional, etc). Mission needs to be concise, descriptive and pragmatic.

Here we need **keywords** and a **mindmap** for defining our **language**.

Always keeping in mind the appropiate **tone** and **mood** for the brand.

### Mapping (Content & Interation)

The proccess comes from:

- Non-visual, **app idea** (words).

To:

- Semi-viaul, **envision** (words, maps, skeches).

Then:

- Visual, **prototype** (experience, final desifns).

So we start the _content mapping_, _developing ideas_, making _paper prototypes_ for some _testing_ and the _visual development_, the actual UI. We also do _wireframing_, _functionality_ / _logic_, some _visual refinement_ and check the _continuity_ / _coherence_ of the UI system.

### Mapping Content

Identify the _main objective_ (usually as home page), each _module_ and its _attributes_, and the potential to _grow by itself_ (scale). It's a **diagram** / map.

### Mappping Interaction

Think about the users posible _pathways_, from the start, to all the _actions_ he can make, all the _inputs_ that should be needed (even optional ones). Independent of visuals, UI elements or specific screens. It's a **flowchart** / map.

### Non-Visual Testing

#### Paper Prototyping

All mapped ideas have to be put on paper, making _revisions_, _moving parts around_ as needed, and looking for _changes_. It's an _internal_ test, developers by themselves will see if the prototype works or not.

#### User Testing

Here the user will be _taking decisions_ from the available _options_, _interacting_ with the system and, if it's all fine, doing what he is supposed to do with the app. Also telling tester whether or not there is a _problem_, something that can't be done or understood.

### Sitemap

A site map is a **hierarchical diagram** of a web / app, that shows how pages are _prioritized_, _linked_, and _labeled_. If the flowchart is like the street view, the sitemap is like the bird's eye view.

Proccess scheme:

1. Content Map & Interaction Map.
2. Paper Prototyping ⟶ Testing UX ⟶ User Testing UX.
3. Sitemap (_here we are_).
4. Wireframe ⟶ Testing UI.
5. Prototyping ⟶ Testing UI ⟶ User Testing UI.

### Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status.
2. Match between the system and the real world.
3. User control and freedom.
4. Consistency and standards.
5. Error prevention.
6. Recognition rather than recall.
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.
10. Help and documentation.

### Wireframe

A wireframe defines **what goes where**.

They are functional, minimal, consistent, and user-centric. Simple and clear.

Creating a wireframe:

- Sketch (hand or computer).
- Geometric shapes and lines.
- Scale ans hierarchy.
- Don't get lost in details.
- Black and white, and grey.
- Placement on screen.
- Resuse elements.
- Visually indicate type of interface elements.

### Prototype

It's made for:

- _Simulating_ the final experience.
- _Refining_ final UI and UX.
- Creating a digital prototype for _realistic_ user testing.

It must simulate:

- The **platfrorm**:
  - Scale (relates to eye).
  - Physicality (relates to body).
  - Visual + Tactile (together).
- The **interface**:
  - Believable UI design.
  - Believable content.
  - Believable language.
- The **Interaction**:
  - Believable UX design.
  - Believable path.
  - Believable responses.
- The **experience**:
  - Believable UI design (needs to be in a screen).
  - Believable UX design (needs to be interactive).
  - Believable platform / context (needs to be physical device).
