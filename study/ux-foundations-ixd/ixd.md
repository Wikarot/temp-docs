# Interaction Design

Can be approached as:

* **Dimensions** of focus
* **Models** of methods and processes
* Guiding **principles**

## Five Dimensions of IxD

By Gillian Crampton Smith and Kevin Silver.

* **Words** (content): should be easy to understand and written to effectively communicate information.
* **Visual representations**: diagrams, illustrations, graphics, and even typographic styles and media to clarify data and concepts.
* **Physical objects or space**: physical hardware, such as keyboard, mouse, or smartphone, and the space necessary to use it effectively.
* **Time**: the time during which people interact with the product and how they might measure their progress.
* **Behavior**: actions, reactions, and emotions people have when interacting with a product.

## Design Thinking

Exploratory and iterative methods are effective when we are facing problems that are vague or not understood.

We need to:

* Understand people and problems.
* Change assumptions.
* Generate solutions.

Different methods helps us to:

* **Diverge**: is the process of generating multiple ideas.
* **Converge**: is the process of choosing the best of those ideas.

### Design Thinking mehtods

1. Observe and empathize.
1. Explore and create.
1. Build and deliver.
1. Iterate and improve.

### Core Design Principles

1. Understand people and their context.
1. Define a product's purpose based on people's needs and goals.
1. Craft experiences for efficient flow.
1. Deliver meaningful, relevant, and valuable experiences.
1. Ensure products easy to use, learn, and remember.
1. Always respect and protect the people who use our products and sercives.

## Levels of design

### Structure

It focus on the overall oreganization and architecture of the product. We identify and define the systematic structire of content and functionality.

#### Scent of Information

It's derived from informatioon foraging theory, this is how people can *predict* what they will find if they follow a path or flow through a product.

#### Three levels of Structure

* **Product**: overall architecture defines all of their sections, the purpouse of each, and the navigation and connections among them.
* **Screen**: what belongs on each page or screen and where should it appear? What appears on all multiple screens? Placement can communicate importance, relationships, and functionality.
* **Component**: define the content and interactivity of individual elements on the screen. We are not yet focused on final appearance, because we first need to validate that the structure and flow are correct.

### Flow

Here we identify and define all of the sreps people must take and the states of the product as they work toward their goal.

#### Three levels of Flow

* **Multi-channel ecosystem**: many products and services are used in conjunction with others. How does the product fit into a larger ecosystem? What are the paths though the product and the states of the product.
* **Product**: indentify the paths through the product and all of the steps and actions necessary to complete tasks. There is at least one path for each function. There may be more than one path to achieve the same goal.
* **Components**: identify abd describe the various states if interactivity screens and components. Define the conditions that produce each and the outcomes that may result.

#### Simple flows

Simple tasks tend to be brief, direct, and linear.

#### Complex flows

Complex tasks tend to have multiple decision points, branching, and repeat actions, and have multiple states contingent upon context and prior interactions or choices.

#### Nested flows

* Flows may also be nested within other flows.
* There may be sub-steps, multiple paths, interactions across products and channels, and multi-session interactions.
* Design to effectively communicate place, state, and progress.

### Interface

At this level, we focus on appearance and behavior, but this is also the stage where we add the polish, nuance, and refinement that can differentiate a product.

#### More than Brand and Identity

Appearance and behavior can:

* Clarify structure and flow.
* Clarify and enhance content
* Guide through a path
* Enhance feedback
* Help people identify opportunities to transfer and apply their prior experiences.

#### Appearance, Meaning, and value

* Good design enhances the value and quality of a product.
* Bad design detracts from or even interferes with a product experience.
* Prople judge the quality of a product higher and think it works better when it is attractive.

## Patterns

### Design patterns

Design patterns are recurring, re-usable, **optimal solutions** to common design problems.

There are DP for structure, flow, and interface.

Good DP are:

* Familiar, recognizable, and easy to apply correctly.
* Optimal, effective, and efficient.
* Relevant in the context and to the goals.
* Effortless and easy to use with minimal work.

> Good design patterns improve consistency and cohesivness, whith makes producs easier to use, learn, and remember.

### Anti-patterns

Anti-patterns are recurring solutions that may be common and familiar, but they are **non-optimal** in practice.

They are non-optimal, but, it doesn't mean they are bad or worst than a pattern. They are just exceptions.

### Dark patterns

Dark patterns **intentionally mislead people** into making choices and performing actions they would not have otherwise chosen to do and which are not in their best interests.

Harry Brignull studied and identified multiple types of dark patterns, such as:

* Bait and switch
* Disguised ads
* Forced continuity
* Friend spam
* Hidden costs
* Misdirection
* Price comparison prevention
* Privacy Zuckering
* Roach motel
* Sneak into basket
* Trick questions

Dark patterns are associated with **violations of privacy**, **theft of money and information**, and the **installation of malware**.

*Features* that can counter a dark pattern from a product:

* Perceivable / Findable.
* Honest / Transparent.
* Notify / Clarify.
* Comparison / Confirmation.
* Reversible / Usable.

## Navigation

Navigation is the movement from place to place or state to state within a product.

### Navigation structure

Information architecture:

* Information architecture as a field and practice is attributed to Richard Saul Wurman.
* It is typically incolved in creating the structire of a navigation system.
* Good information architecture is often considered essential for good interaction design.

Mental models we have about:

* How information should be organized.
* Flows and the sequence of steps is will take to perform an action.
* Tasks organized into a logical sequence of steps (that will be easier to complete).

### Navigation systems

Types of navogation systems:

* **Hierarchical**: used when there are multiple levels, or hierarchies, in the structure of the content and functionality.
* **Hub and spoke**: there is a central hub from which to explore and browse. There are often several independent sections, and each may have different content or functions.
* **Adaptive**: navigation adjusts dynamically to the context, content, and how it is being used.
  * Inditivual access privileges.
  * Suggested actions based on context.
  * Valid actions based on section or content.
* **Steam**: used when there is a steady stream of new content or posts, presented in reverse chronological order, may be algorithms to promote sponsored or popular content.
* **Search sort, and filter**: effective when there are vast amounts of content, whether or not it is well-organized.
* **Interactive or gestural**: used when navigation elements are revealed after an interaction, often lack signals or cues, so they may be difficult to discover. We shall use hints and cues to indicate that actions are available.
* **Content link**: links in the content of a page or screen are a form of contextually relevant navigation.
* **Hybrid**: when mixing different types of navigation into a single system.

#### Findability vs Discoverability

*Findability* is when a person **knows in advance** that something is or should be within the product. **Discoverability** is when a person **does not know in advance** that something exists and is available within that product.

## Content

### Content strategy

* It guides the creation, publication, and maintenance of meaningful, relevant content.
* Content creation is an essential part of the design process.
* Content takes many form.

### Design with text

* **Readability**: is the ease with which a reader can understand weitten text. We need to use *appropriate vocabulary* and syntax based on context of the product.
* **Scanning**: organize text to facilitate scanning to *help people focus* their attention and fin what they need.
* **Typography**: optimize fint size, line height, and line lenght. Also text styles are used to differentiate among text types, headers, labels, body content, and links.
* **Interactivity**: expose only the necessary information to *keep the product focused and simpler*. Extencive content may benefit from interactive layouts that conceal and reveal supplemental information as needed.

### Microcopy

Small pieces of text found throughout the interface, important for clarity and guidance. Such as buttons, labels, status and progress indicators.

### Localization

* Language.
* Numeric, date, and time formats.
* Use of currency.
* Keyboard usage.
* Collation and sorting.
* Symbols, icons, and colors.
* Culturally appropiate text and graphics.
* Varyng legal requirements, among others.

### Imagery

* Images have high information density. They can convey much in a small amount of space.
* Enable pan and zoom for exploration of large, highly detailed images.

### Interactive images and media

* Highly interactive content experiences can be very engaging.
* Interactions should support and enhance the information and improve comprehension.
* Design interacive media with the same principles used to design products.

### Media controls

* Auto-play should be used only when requested and expected.
* When not requested, auto-play distracts and interrupts.
* Removing control over auto-playing media is an undesirable and negative experience.

## Inputs

### Bi-directional data flow

* Interaction is bi-directional. People add and receive information.
* Data can be entered many ways through input devices and sensors.
* Data may be gathered without explicit interaction. (Such as GPS location or ambient brightness).
